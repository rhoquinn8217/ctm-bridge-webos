/* Controller abstraction (D2). One mechanism per detected controller: each
 * type supplies an ops vtable; the factory picks the right ops for a device.
 *
 * STAGE 1 (scaffold, this commit): the interface + classification (matches) +
 * the factory. The shared byte pump in controller_common.c and the wiring into
 * plug_in_item are STAGE 2 — until then these ops do not yet drive live
 * sessions; the proven tv_bridge_worker / ctm_hidraw_bridge paths still run.
 *
 * The layer is UI-independent: the app fills a neutral ctm_controller_dev_t
 * from its logical_device_t, so controllers/ does not depend on app/ types. */
